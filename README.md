This was a Spring 2018 class project for Mike Massimino's "Human Space Flight" class.  The project was entitled, Autonomous Inventory Management System (AIMS) for the ISS.  I leave the code here in case others want to modifty it to communicate with the M5E ThingMagic RFID reader. 

The code is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi, and because it uses Raspberry Pi specific features (serial comm.), it will only work on another RPi (unless it is modified to do so).  

I've sense cleaned up the code somewhat recently and installed a few example files to run it (config1 and config2).  

The m5e.py code (originally from [here](https://github.com/ctralie/hospirfidbot/blob/master/M5e.py)) still has some legacy code that I never fully cleaned up.  Thank you, Travis Deyle, for allowing your code to be used by others.
