This code has been largely abandoned.  If you decide you want to use the code and need my help working with it, please contact me, and I'll do my best.  

This was a Spring 2018 class project for Mike Massimino's "Human Space Flight" class.  The project was entitled, Autonomous Inventory Management System (AIMS) for the ISS.  I leave the code here in case others want to modifty it to communicate with the M5E ThingMagic RFID reader. 

The code needs to be cleaned up, but realistically, I've abandoned it.
